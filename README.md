# Interjs
Inter is a Javascript library designed to build interactive front-end applications.
It's: simple, intuitive and powerful.

# If you know Javascript, you know Inter

<div id="exemple">
  <p>Hey, { message }</p>
</div>

```javascript
toHTML({
in:"exemple",
data:{
message:"i program in Inter!"
},
react:"change"
})
```

# There is no directives

Directives are good for simple interactivities, but in complex situations
it's weaknesses is obvious, rather than use directives,  *Inter* use just the *Jvascrit*
that you already Know.

```html
<p></p>
```
